# Overview

- Adds a more offensive oriented alternative to Engineer's Bouncing Grenades; Gauss Scatter, a powerful automatic gauss shotgun that excels at close range self defense but lacks AoE, mid-long range capabilities, and has falloff.
- Also adds a more aggressive alternative to Engineer's mines; Plasma Grenades, two powerful, aimable contact grenades that detonate on impact, leaving a large pool of plasma that damages and slows monsters in its AoE! However, you only start out with two, and you give up the capability of setting up powerful traps and fortifying your position more effectively.

Note: Due to the nature of Engineer's playstyle and Hopoo's balancing of the Engineer, we understand that the Gauss Shotgun is always going to be better/a direct upgrade to the Engineer's vanilla Bouncing Grenades. This is by design and 100% intentional, as whilst the grenades are meant to be weaker to balance out the Engineer, they are not fun or engaging to use. Shotguns are required to be reasonably powerful to be fun and engaging to use, so this convention is unfortunately violated, making the Engineer fairly more powerful than he already is.

Recommended to be used with Moffein's MobileTurretBuff (https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/MobileTurretBuff/) and Chen's ChensMinionRetarget (https://thunderstore.io/package/Chen/ChensMinionRetarget/) to aid in making a more effective, engaging Combat Engineer playstyle.
